We collect location data to provide essential services through the BuzRyde app. Here’s how we use your location data:

Ensure Safety & Emergency Features: Help us monitor your journey for security purposes and provide timely assistance in case of emergencies.
Optimize Services: Enhance routing efficiency and dispatch drivers to you faster.
Note: You have control over your location-sharing settings and can turn off background location tracking at any time through your device settings. However, disabling background access may impact features like receiving timely driver notifications when the app is not open.
